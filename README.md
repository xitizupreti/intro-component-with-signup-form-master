## Overview
Just a simple QR Sign UP form with the help of HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
As usual 1st HTML Model then added CSS properties and finally used JS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

```box-shadow: none|h-offset v-offset blur spread color |inset|initial|inherit;```<br><br>
``` ::placeholder{} => To change placeholder color ```<br><br>
``` as an advantage with filter:drop-shadow you can generate shadow around irregular shapes or images, whereas box-shadows generates a rectangular shadow. ```<br><br>
```display:block/none (useful while toggle)```

### Useful resources

- [Section Vs Div](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-section-and-div-tags-in-html/) - This helped me for understanding their difference. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Outline](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_outline.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Outline. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Pattern in Input field](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_pattern.asp) - To be honest, I didn't know about this attribute till working on this project.
- [JavaScript RegExp test()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_test.asp) - This article helped me understand about pattern test in email input fields.
- [JavaScript Object.assign()](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/library/object/assign) - This was very important for me to create style in one variable and use it anywhere.
